### User Input

List my notebooks using the notebooklm tool.

*Listed resources from notebooklm*

*Searched filesystem*

### Planner Response

I don't currently see a `notebooklm` tool available in my equipped tools, nor do I see an active MCP server named `notebooklm` (I tried listing resources for it and it wasn't found). 

It looks like the MCP server that provides this tool might not be running or hasn't connected successfully. Would you like me to help you debug the MCP configuration, or do you want to try restarting the server that provides this tool?
