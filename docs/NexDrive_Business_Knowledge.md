# NexDrive Academy: Master Business Knowledge

> **Instructions for Rob:** 
> Dump EVERYTHING the Voice Agent needs to know into this document. 
> You do NOT need to format it perfectly. Gemini is smart enough to read raw text, copy-pasted website FAQs, messy pricing tables, and ACT government PDFs.
> 
> *Examples of what to paste below:*
> - The exact pricing of all lesson packages.
> - Your cancellation policy.
> - The areas you service in Canberra.
> - The basic requirements for the ACT CBT&A logbook methods.
> - How a student books a lesson.
> - Any specific personality traits the AI should have (e.g. "Never promise a specific test date").
