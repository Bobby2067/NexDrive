# NexDrive Academy — Product Brief
### BMAD Phase 1 | Business Analyst Agent
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 20 February 2026  
**Status:** Complete — Stakeholder Validated  
**Project Complexity:** Level 3 (Enterprise)  
**Build Method:** AI-Assisted Development (Claude Code, Cursor, AI agents)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

NexDrive Academy is building an enterprise-grade digital platform to transform a premium Canberra-based driving school into a technology-differentiated, scalable driving education business. The platform integrates AI-powered voice and text assistance, digital competency tracking with ACT Government audit compliance, a parent/supervisor coaching ecosystem, custom booking and payments, and full business operations — designed from day one for multi-instructor scaling.

**The core thesis:** In a fragmented market where every competitor sells hours, NexDrive sells *judgement* — and the platform exists to operationalize, scale, and prove that difference.

**Build approach:** Enterprise architecture constructed primarily by AI development agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), with specialist APIs for voice agents and targeted contract development where needed. This delivers enterprise-grade capability at a fraction of traditional development cost — token costs instead of salaries.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Industry Problems
The Australian driver training industry suffers from three structural failures:

**Inconsistency Gap:** The biggest barrier to learner progress isn't lesson quality — it's the disconnect between professional instruction and the 90+ hours of supervised home practice. Parents supervise without training, often contradicting professional techniques, creating confusion and conflict. Many supervising parents are themselves poor drivers reinforcing bad habits.

**Paper-Based Compliance:** ACT CBT&A requires tracking 23+ competency tasks across structured lessons, review assessments, and a final drive — all on paper forms (Form 10.044). This creates audit vulnerability, data loss risk, and zero analytics capability. No Canberra provider has digitized this process.

**Commodity Perception:** Every competitor markets on price, convenience, and pass rates. No provider communicates *how* they teach or *why* their method produces better outcomes. The market has no premium tier backed by measurable differentiation. Cheaper hourly fees may actually produce poorer drivers — but no one communicates this.

### 2.2 Business Problems for NexDrive
Rob currently operates as sole instructor with 20-30 active students, delivering 6-8 lessons per day at $100-110/hour. All booking is via phone and text — no system exists.

**Missed revenue:** Every lesson hour Rob is instructing (6-8 hours/day), inbound calls and texts go unanswered. Unknown but significant number of prospects lost weekly to competitors with online booking or who simply answer the phone.

**Admin overhead:** Scheduling, invoicing, record-keeping, and parent communication consume available non-teaching time. Paper CBT&A forms (Form 10.044) require handwritten entries per lesson with dual signatures, competency number tracking, odometer readings, and free-text comments.

**No digital presence:** Domain registered but no functional website. LTrent dominates Canberra SEO with blogs, free tools, and structured content while NexDrive is invisible online.

**Paper compliance risk:** CBT&A lesson checklists and Certificates of Competency (Form 165751) are paper-only. Loss, damage, or incomplete records create audit vulnerability.

**Unscalable expertise:** Rob's teaching methodology, industry knowledge, and coaching approach are locked in his head. No mechanism to deliver value beyond 1:1 car time.

**No growth pathway:** Adding instructors requires a platform. Currently no infrastructure for independent contractors to manage their own schedules, students, and compliance under the NexDrive brand.

---

## 3. Product Vision

> *"The platform that makes NexDrive Academy the most technologically advanced driving school in Australia — not for technology's sake, but because better tools create better drivers."*

### Vision Statement
Build a unified platform that:
1. **Digitizes the entire learner journey** from first inquiry to licence acquisition
2. **Extends Rob's expertise beyond the car** through AI, content, and parent training
3. **Creates audit-grade compliance** that exceeds ACT Government requirements
4. **Provides 24/7 intelligent assistance** via voice, SMS, and web chat to students, parents, and prospects
5. **Generates measurable evidence** of superior teaching outcomes
6. **Scales to multi-instructor operation** with independent contractor support from day one

### Tagline
**"Hours Build Familiarity. Together We Build Judgement."**

### Privacy Philosophy
Students need privacy and trust with their instructor. Parents need transparency if they're paying. This is a tough bridge to navigate. The platform resolves it through student-controlled visibility — learners choose what parents can see, while instructors maintain private coaching notes that never surface.

---

## 4. Target Users & Personas

### Persona 1: The Learner (Primary User)
**Demographics:** 16-19 years old (80%), 20-35 years old (15%), 35+ mature learners (5%)  
**Context:** Holds ACT Learner licence, needs 100 logbook hours (10 night), must complete CBT&A tasks, preparing for Hazard Perception Test and Practical Driving Assessment  
**Pain Points:**
- Anxious about driving, especially first lessons
- Confused by different advice from instructor vs parents
- No visibility into what competencies they've achieved or what's next
- Can't get answers outside lesson time
- Paper logbook (Form 10.044) is easy to lose and hard to interpret
- Wants privacy from parents about certain aspects of their learning

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- Track my progress and know what I still need to learn
- Get answers about driving questions between lessons (text or chat)
- Book and manage my lessons easily without phone calls
- Show my parents what to practice with me — on my terms
- Feel confident, not judged
- Self-assess before review lessons using the Driver Trainer checklist

### Persona 2: The Supervising Parent (Key Stakeholder)
**Demographics:** 40-55 years old, employed professional, time-poor  
**Context:** Legally responsible for supervising 90+ hours of practice, emotionally invested in child's safety, often anxious in passenger seat. May themselves be a poor driver with limited awareness of current road rules and best practice techniques.  
**Pain Points:**
- Doesn't know *how* to teach driving effectively — and may not recognise their own bad habits
- Gets frustrated/anxious → learner gets tense → both get upset
- No visibility into what the instructor covered (even though they're paying)
- Feels disconnected from the professional instruction
- Worried about road conflict damaging parent-child relationship

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- Understand what Rob taught so I can reinforce it (not contradict it)
- Learn techniques to stay calm and coach effectively
- Know what to practice and in what order
- Feel confident I'm helping, not hindering
- Preserve my relationship with my teenager
- See enough to know my investment is worthwhile

### Persona 3: Rob Ogilvie (Instructor / Business Owner)
**Demographics:** Experienced ADI (ADI No. 608), sole operator scaling to multi-instructor  
**Context:** Delivers 6-8 lessons/day to 20-30 active students at $100-110/hr. Manages all aspects of the business — instruction, scheduling (phone/text only), invoicing, compliance, parent communication. Cannot answer calls or texts while instructing, losing unknown but significant prospect volume.  
**Pain Points:**
- Paper CBT&A forms slow, error-prone, and audit-risky
- Cannot answer phone during 6-8 hours of daily instruction — prospects lost
- Admin consumes all non-teaching time
- Can't scale expertise beyond 1:1 lessons
- No data on student outcomes or business performance
- No digital presence while competitors dominate online
- Needs industry-knowledgeable AI that understands road rules, regulations, and business context

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- Sign off competencies in <90 seconds on my phone — tap, tick, sign, done
- Never miss another prospect call — AI answers, books, or takes a message
- Respond to student texts via AI when I'm teaching
- Reduce admin time by 50%+
- Give parents and students resources without repeating myself
- Track business performance and student outcomes
- Never worry about an ACT Government audit
- Scale to multiple instructors as independent contractors on the platform

### Persona 4: The Prospect (Pre-Customer)
**Demographics:** Parent researching driving schools for their teenager, or adult learner researching for themselves  
**Pain Points:**
- All driving schools look the same online
- Can't tell quality apart from marketing
- Tempted by cheaper hourly rates without understanding the tradeoff
- Worried about choosing the wrong instructor
- Can't get through on the phone during business hours

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- Quickly understand why NexDrive is different (and worth the premium)
- See evidence of quality outcomes, not just marketing claims
- Book easily without phone calls — anytime, 24/7
- Get answers to common questions instantly (chat, SMS, or voice)
- Understand why cheaper hourly fees might actually cost more in total lessons

## 5. Market Analysis

### 5.1 Market Size (Canberra ACT)
- **Population:** ~470,000
- **Annual new learner permits:** ~5,000-6,000
- **Average spend per learner on professional lessons:** $1,500-$3,000
- **Estimated total addressable market:** $7.5M-$18M annually
- **Active competitors:** 10+ providers

### 5.2 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Price/hr | Strength | Weakness | Rating |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| LTrent | $80-85 | Scale, SEO, 71% pass rate claim, free tools | Template site, impersonal, NSW testimonials on ACT page | 4.0/5 |
| Carl's Driver Training | $95 | Warm/personal, bilingual, clear pricing | Amateur website (Zyro), single-page, no content depth | 3.2/5 |
| National Driving | Package | Afterpay, multi-instructor, gift cards | Placeholder text live, generic, no outcome data | 3.3/5 |
| Pinnacle Driving | $80 | Named instructors, specialist courses, family-owned | Limited content, BookingTimes template look | 3.2/5 |
| Safeway | $70 | Budget leader | Basic everything | N/A |
| Apex | $100 | Premium positioning, WRX | No digital differentiation | N/A |

### 5.3 Market Gaps (NexDrive Opportunity)
1. **No competitor offers a digital student portal** with competency tracking
2. **No competitor provides parent/supervisor training** resources
3. **No competitor uses AI** for student, prospect, or business support (voice, SMS, or chat)
4. **No competitor publishes pedagogical methodology** — all sell generic "lessons"
5. **No competitor has digitized CBT&A compliance** — all use paper Form 10.044
6. **No competitor uses outcome-based messaging** beyond pass rate claims
7. **No competitor offers co-lessons** as a structured product
8. **No competitor can answer calls 24/7** — all lose prospects to voicemail

### 5.4 Positioning Strategy
**NexDrive occupies the premium-outcome quadrant** — higher price justified by measurably better results, superior technology, and the co-lesson model that reduces total lessons needed.

**Premium messaging:** Cheaper hourly fees don't mean cheaper overall. Students with poor instruction need more lessons. NexDrive's approach builds judgement faster, meaning fewer total hours and a safer driver at the end.

**Competitive moat:** The platform itself becomes a barrier to imitation. Competitors cannot replicate the AI knowledge base, digital competency system, voice agent, or parent coaching ecosystem without significant investment and expertise.

### Module 7: Custom Booking & Scheduling System
**Purpose:** Full-featured booking system with deep integration to competency tracking, built custom for data sovereignty  

**Decision: Build, Not Buy**
BookitLive and similar SaaS platforms were evaluated and rejected. Rationale:
1. Booking must integrate deeply with competency data (suggest lesson types based on progress, flag review readiness)
2. Data sovereignty — student records, financials, and competency sign-offs are competitive advantage AND regulatory obligation. No proprietary business/sales data going to external platforms.
3. Booking features are well-understood engineering — calendar, time slots, reminders
4. Custom system future-proofs multi-instructor contractor model with territory/schedule management
5. Eliminates ongoing SaaS dependency ($2K-$4K/year) for a system you own permanently

**Key Features:**
- **Availability Calendar:** Instructor sets working hours, blocks holidays/unavailable times
- **Public Booking Flow:** Select service (60/90/120 min lesson, co-lesson, pre-test, etc.) → choose date/time → enter details → pay or confirm
- **Service Types:** Learner Lesson (60 min), Extended Lesson (90 min), Intensive Session (120 min), Co-Lesson (with parent/supervisor), Pre-Test Preparation, Review Assessment, Confidence Coaching
- **Automated Confirmations & Reminders:** SMS + email via Twilio and Resend
- **Package Management:** Prepaid lesson packages, vouchers, gift cards, promotional codes
- **Cancellation Policy Enforcement:** Configurable notice period, automatic fee application
- **Waitlist:** Auto-notify when preferred time opens up
- **Admin Calendar:** Drag-to-reschedule, colour-coded by lesson type, daily/weekly/monthly views
- **Intelligent Scheduling:** Suggest next lesson based on competency progress, flag overdue students, identify review-ready students
- **Multi-Instructor Support:** Each contractor manages own availability, sees own students, within NexDrive platform (from day one architecture)

**Success Metrics:** >90% online booking adoption, <2% scheduling conflicts, zero double-bookings

### Module 8: CRM & Business Intelligence
**Purpose:** Manage client relationships and generate business insights  
**Key Features:**
- Full student lifecycle tracking (prospect → enrolled → active → completed → alumni)
- Parent/supervisor linking with visibility controls
- Automated communication workflows (booking confirmations, reminders, follow-ups, re-engagement)
- Lead scoring from all channels (web, voice, SMS, chat, referral)
- Referral tracking and attribution
- Instructor performance analytics (per-contractor in multi-instructor model)
- Student progression analytics (average lessons to competency, completion rates, time-to-licence)

### Module 9: Payment Processing
**Purpose:** Flexible, modern payment handling with Australian banking focus  

**Payment Gateway:** To be selected — research required. Requirements:
- Australian bank direct debit/credit card as primary method

## 15. Budget Framework (AI-Built Approach)

### Development Investment
| Category | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| AI development tokens (Claude, Cursor, etc.) | $5K-$15K | Primary build method |
| Contract developer (complex pieces) | $10K-$30K | If needed for specific integrations |
| Design assets (logo, brand, UI) | $3K-$8K | Professional brand identity |
| Content production (videos, guides) | $10K-$25K | Parent resources, competency hub videos |
| **Total Development** | **$28K-$78K** | |

### Annual Infrastructure & APIs
| Service | Annual Cost |
|---------|------------|
| Hosting (Vercel + Railway) | $2K-$5K |
| Database (Supabase) | $1K-$3K |
| AI/RAG (Claude API + Vector DB) | $3K-$8K |
| Voice Agent API | $2K-$6K (usage-based, ~$0.10-0.50/min) |
| SMS (Twilio) | $1K-$3K |
| Email (Resend) | $0.5K-$1K |
| Payment gateway fees | Variable (% of transactions) |
| Auth, Analytics, Storage | $2K-$4K |
| **Total Infrastructure** | **$12K-$30K** |

### Total
- **Year 1 (build + run):** $40K-$108K
- **Ongoing Annual:** $12K-$30K

### ROI Context
At $105/hr average × 7 lessons/day × 5 days/week × 48 weeks = **~$176K annual revenue (current)**. Platform needs to either save significant admin time, capture lost prospects, or enable growth (more students, more instructors) to justify investment. Even capturing 2 additional students per month from missed calls covers the annual infrastructure cost.
